# 42Berlin_ft_printf

---
<h1>What is ft_printf?</h1>
The third project at 42 programming school. It consists of a static library that contains ft_printf - a function that mimics the real printf - and another library (Libft, the first project at 42) with recoded standard functions in C to support the project's development. It's an extremely useful function that does a series of base conversions (decimal and hexadecimal) and makes the output much easier - especially when compared to its predecessor in 42 - the system call write. The function can be used in future projects.
